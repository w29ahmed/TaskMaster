# TaskMaster
A bare bones todo list web app made using Flask.

This was created with the assistance of a [Flask crash course youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1RJmh_OqeA) in order to build a familiarity with creating and deploying web apps using Flask. Outside of a few comments I added in for my clarity, it is pretty much an exact copy and I don't claim this to be my code. Original repo can be found [here](https://github.com/jakerieger/FlaskIntroduction).

Deployed using Heroku, live app can be found [here](https://waleedtaskmaster.herokuapp.com/)
